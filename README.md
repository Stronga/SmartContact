# The Project

## Project Description:
The Project will allow users to organize their email contacts into groups and select from these groups when composing emails to easily fill in the recipient's field.

## The problem it solves:
Users with extensive contact lists may find it challenging to manage and send emails to multiple recipients. Choosing multiple recipients each time you need to send an email can be tedious and time-consuming. Users will be able to organize contacts into groups with the application and seamlessly integrate it with their email client. In this way, it will be much easier to manage and select emails to multiple recipients, resulting in less time and effort spending.

## Usage scenario:
1. Added new contacts and provided their name, email address, and other details including phone numbers or organizations.
2. Creating groups and categorizing contacts into these groups based on common attributes such as work colleagues, friends, or family.
3. Browsing and searching through the list of contacts and groups to quickly find the desired recipients.
4. While composing an email, users can choose recipients either by selecting individual contacts or entire groups. Clicking on the corresponding button will then open their default email client with the recipient list already populated.

## Data/Information Used:
The application collects contact information such as name, email, phone number, and organization, as well as group information including the names of each group and the contacts that belong to each group.

## Data Source:
- User Input: Users can manually add new contacts and create groups within the application.
- Import from Email Client: Future updates may include it.
- External APIs: By integrating with external services such as Google Contacts or Microsoft Outlook, users can sync their contacts with the application.(future update)
